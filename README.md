Computer vision script for simulating  gaming racing wheel

## Short description
When the program is started three windows will open. All three windows are webcams. One is at a normal position, one is rotated by 40 degrees and the last one is rotated by -40 degrees. All three at the same time are trying to detect a person's head each frame of the recording. If the first normal one detects head then the program knows that person is holding the head at a natural position. If a camera with a 40-degree angle detects head then the program knows that person tilted head on the right side and presses the D key on the keyboard. If a camera with a -40 degree angle detects head then the program knows that person tilted head on the left side and presses the A key on the keyboard.
